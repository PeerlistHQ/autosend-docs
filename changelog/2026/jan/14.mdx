You asked, we built it. You can now send emails through AutoSend using SMTP as well as the REST API.

### How It Works

1. **Simple setup** - Go to Settings → SMTP to get your credentials. Host, port, and username are pre-configured. Generate an API key to use as your password.

2. **Standard SMTP** - Connect using `smtp.autosend.com` on port 587 with TLS. Works with any SMTP client, library, or platform that supports standard SMTP.

3. **Same deliverability** - All the benefits of AutoSend's sending infrastructure. Same reputation, same analytics, same reliability.

Perfect for legacy systems, platforms with built-in SMTP support, or if you just prefer SMTP over REST.

## Improvements

1. **Better analytics UI** - Campaign and automation analytics now show clicked status sections. Empty states are cleaner and more helpful.

2. **Contact sorting** - You can now sort contacts via the API. Useful for paginating through large contact lists in a specific order.

## Bug Fixes

1. **Date filter equals** - Fixed an issue where filtering contacts by an exact date wasn't working correctly.

2. **Campaigns count** - Fixed incorrect campaign counts in the campaigns list.
