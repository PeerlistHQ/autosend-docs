We've shipped major improvements to how you track campaign performance and how quickly your emails reach inboxes. This release focuses on clarity, speed, and reliability.

## Improvements

### Improved Analytics

Campaign and automation analytics are now easier to understand and faster to load. Email status tooltips explain what each status means and what action to take. Date/time formatting is now consistent across all views for easier comparison.

### Faster Campaign Delivery

We upgraded our sending infrastructure to improve speed and reliability. Campaigns now reach inboxes faster with fewer delivery errors, especially for large contact lists.

## Bug Fixes

We fixed several issues that were causing friction:

1. **Image width in emails** - Fixed images breaking email responsiveness on mobile devices. Images now scale properly regardless of screen size.
2. **Image library insertion** - Resolved a bug where inserting images from your library would fail silently. Now it just works.
3. **Segment evaluation queue** - Fixed an issue in the segment evaluation queue that were causing segments to refresh incorrectly.
