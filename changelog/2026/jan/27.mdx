Let's be honest. Logging into your email platform should feel productive, not overwhelming. You want to see what matters: your key metrics, active campaigns, and what's new. No hunting through menus, no scrolling past irrelevant data.

We've redesigned the <a href={AUTOSEND_PATHS.dashboard} target="_blank" title="Dashboard">dashboard</a> from the ground up and launched a fresh new landing page that better showcases what AutoSend can do.

## What's New

### 1. Dashboard That Actually Shows What You Need

Your dashboard now surfaces everything important right when you log in:

- **Analytics at a glance**: Key metrics like sends, opens, clicks, and bounces front and center. No more digging through reports.
- **Active campaigns first**: See what's scheduled or running right now.
- **Product updates**: Stay in the loop with the latest features and improvements we've shipped, without checking our changelog manually.

The new dashboard is designed to answer your first question every time you log in: "What's happening with my emails?"

### 2. Fresh Landing Page

We've completely redesigned our landing page with a modern look that better explains what AutoSend does. New interactive sections, smoother animations, and a clearer story about how we help you send better emails.

## More Improvements

### Faster CSV Imports

Importing large contact lists just got way faster. Upload your CSV and get back to work. We'll let you know when it's done.


### User ID Support in CSV Imports

You can now import user IDs along with your contact data. Perfect if you're syncing contacts from your own database and want to maintain consistent identifiers across systems.

Check the <a href={APP_PATHS.contactsImportCsv} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSV Import Guide</a> for details.

### List-Unsubscribe Header

We've added the standard `List-Unsubscribe` header to all emails sent through AutoSend. This helps email clients like Gmail and Apple Mail show one-click unsubscribe buttons, improving deliverability and keeping you compliant with email best practices.

It just works. No configuration needed.

## Fixes

We've also squashed a handful of bugs this release:

- Fixed campaign analytics not refreshing properly when switching between campaigns
- Resolved dark mode styling issues with the payment alert banner
- Improved link formatting in the email builder for better reliability
