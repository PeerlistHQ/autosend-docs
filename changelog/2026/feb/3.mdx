## What's New

### Quick Create Menu

Create campaigns and automations from the dashboard itself. Click the "+" button on top right corner to access a quick create menu without navigating away from your current page.

### Faster Campaign and Analytics Loading

We've optimized how we fetch campaigns and analytics data. Dashboards load faster, and switching between views is noticeably snappier. Behind the scenes, we added caching for workflow analytics and streamlined campaign queries.

**Additional improvements:**
- Separated worker services for email sending, validation, and webhooks to handle higher loads independently
- Lazy loading for past and failed campaigns to reduce initial page load times
- Automatic favicon support when project logos aren't uploaded

## Fixes

We've also squashed a few bugs:

- Fixed invited users being redirected to the welcome screen instead of their team's workspace
- Resolved analytics text alignment issues that made numbers hard to read
- Added SMTP rate limiting API to prevent sending spikes and improve deliverability
