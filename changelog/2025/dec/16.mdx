You asked for this one a lot. Email isn't a one-person job: campaigns, newsletters, transactional emails, there's usually a team behind it all. Now AutoSend works the way your team actually works.

### What’s new

1. **Invite your team** Head to <a href={AUTOSEND_PATHS.team} target='_blank' title='Team'>Settings → Team</a> to find your new dashboard. Add as many people as you need.
2. **Same access for everyone** No permission levels to configure. Everyone you invite can do everything you can. Simple.
3. **The invite flow** You send an invite, they get an email with a secure link, they click it, they’re in. You get notified when they join.
4. **The details** Invites are valid for 7 days. You can resend or cancel them anytime. Team members need to join with the same email you invited.

That's it. Go to <a href={AUTOSEND_PATHS.team} target='_blank' title='Team'>Settings → Team</a> and start sending emails with your team.

Happy collaborating!
