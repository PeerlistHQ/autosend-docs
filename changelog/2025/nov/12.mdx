We’ve been busy building here! This week we shipped two of the most requested features from our community - <a href={APP_PATHS.webhookIntroduction} title='Webhooks'>Webhooks</a> and <a href={`${APP_PATHS.sendEmail}#body-attachments`} title='Email attachments'>Email Attachments</a>. Both have been on top of our roadmap, and we’re excited to finally get them into your hands. Let’s dive into more details.

## New features

### Webhooks Support
    1. You can now listen to real-time email events directly in your app. Available on Pro 10k plans and above.
    2. We’ve added a dedicated Webhooks dashboard where you can create and manage all your webhook configs in one place.
    3. Here’s what you can track:
        1. Email events:
            - Delivery lifecycle: `email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.deferred`
            - Engagement: `email.opened`, `email.clicked`
            - Issues: `email.bounced`, `email.spam_reported`
            - Preferences: `email.unsubscribed`, `email.group_unsubscribed`, `email.group_resubscribed`
    
        2. Contact events:
            - `contact.created`, `contact.updated`, `contact.deleted`

    No more polling APIs or checking dashboards manually. Get instant notifications when things happen. Check out the <a href={APP_PATHS.webhookIntroduction} title='Webhooks'>webhooks docs</a>.

### Send Emails with Attachments
    You can now attach files to your emails. Upload via base64, reference files from S3, or pass external URLs, we’ll handle the rest.
    
    Here’s what’s supported:

    - Multiple input methods: Base64 uploads, S3 file paths, or external URLs
    - Generous limits: Up to 20 attachments per email, 40MB per file
    - Currently works with all transactional emails

    Whether you’re sending invoices, reports, or onboarding documents, attachments just work.

## Fixes

The pricing page during onboarding were facing some data issues. No more squinting at plan details or wondering which tier includes what.

<Info>
As always, let us know if you run into issues or have feedback at <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`} title='AutoSend support mail'>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>. We’re listening (and probably already working on the next thing you didn’t know you needed).
