We're excited to announce the launch of <a href={AUTOSEND_PATHS.webhooks} target='_blank' title='Webhooks'>Webhooks</a> in AutoSend! You can now receive real-time notifications about email events, contact changes, and engagement metrics—all delivered directly to your application via HTTP callbacks.

## What's New

### Real-Time Event Notifications

Receive instant notifications when events occur in your AutoSend account. Instead of continuously polling our API, webhooks push data to your application immediately when events happen.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get notified instantly when emails are sent, delivered, opened, clicked, or bounced
- **Contact Sync**: Automatically sync contact changes (created, updated, deleted) to your CRM or database
- **Engagement Tracking**: Track email opens, clicks, and unsubscribes in real-time
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger custom workflows based on specific events
- **Compliance Logging**: Maintain audit logs for all email and contact activities

### Event Types

AutoSend webhooks support three comprehensive categories of events:

**Email Lifecycle Events:**
- `email.sent` - Email successfully sent to the recipient's mail server
- `email.delivered` - Email successfully delivered to the recipient
- `email.bounced` - Email failed to deliver (with bounce type and reason)

**Email Engagement Events:**
- `email.opened` - Recipient opened the email
- `email.clicked` - Recipient clicked a link in the email
- `email.unsubscribed` - Recipient unsubscribed from your emails

**Contact Events:**
- `contact.created` - New contact created in your project
- `contact.updated` - Contact information updated
- `contact.deleted` - Contact deleted from your project

Each webhook payload includes comprehensive event data including email IDs, contact information, timestamps, and event-specific details.

### Security & Signature Verification

All webhooks are secured with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification to ensure requests are genuinely from AutoSend.

**Security Features:**
- **HMAC-SHA256 Signatures**: Every webhook includes an `X-Webhook-Signature` header for verification
- **HTTPS Only**: All webhooks are delivered over secure HTTPS connections
- **Secret Tokens**: Each webhook has a unique secret token for signature verification
- **Constant-Time Comparison**: Built-in protection against timing attacks
- **Timestamp Validation**: Optional timestamp validation to reject old requests

**Headers Included:**
- `X-Webhook-Signature` - HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body
- `X-Webhook-Event` - The event type (e.g., `email.opened`)
- `X-Webhook-Delivery-Id` - Unique delivery identifier for tracking
- `X-Webhook-Timestamp` - Unix timestamp when webhook was sent

### Automatic Retries

AutoSend automatically handles failed webhook deliveries with intelligent retry logic.

**Retry Schedule:**
- **1st Retry**: 1 minute after initial failure
- **2nd Retry**: 5 minutes after first retry
- **3rd Retry**: 15 minutes after second retry
- **Total Attempts**: 4 attempts (initial + 3 retries)

**Retry Triggers:**
- Non-2xx status codes (400, 401, 500, 503, etc.)
- Network errors (connection refused, DNS failures)
- Timeouts (no response within 10 seconds)
- SSL/TLS errors

**Best Practices:**
- Respond with 2xx status codes within 10 seconds
- Process webhooks asynchronously for better performance
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries
- Log all delivery attempts for debugging

Manage your webhooks easily through the AutoSend dashboard.

**Features:**
- **Create Multiple Webhooks**: Create up to 100 webhooks per project
- **Event Selection**: Choose which events each webhook should receive
- **Webhook Status**: View enabled/disabled status for each webhook
- **Edit & Delete**: Update webhook settings or remove webhooks as needed
