We’ve been busy building here! This week we shipped two of the most requested features from our community - webhooks and email attachments. Both have been high on our roadmap, and we’re excited to finally get them into your hands. Let’s dive into more details.

## New features

1. ###  Webhooks Support
    1. You can now listen to real-time email events directly in your app. Available on Pro 10k plans and above.
    2. We’ve added a dedicated Webhooks dashboard where you can create and manage all your webhook configs in one place.
    3. Here’s what you can track:
        1. Email events:
            - Delivery lifecycle: `email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.deferred`
            - Engagement: `email.opened`, `email.clicked`
            - Issues: `email.bounced`, `email.spam_reported`
            - Preferences: `email.unsubscribed`, `email.group_unsubscribed`, `email.group_resubscribed`
    
        2. Contact events:
            - `contact.created`, `contact.updated`, `contact.deleted`

    No more polling APIs or checking dashboards manually. Get instant notifications when things happen.Check out the webhooks docs.

2. ###  Send Emails with Attachments
    You can now attach files to your emails. Upload via base64, reference files from S3, or pass external URLs, we’ll handle the rest.
    
    Here’s what’s supported:

    - Multiple input methods: Base64 uploads, S3 file paths, or external URLs
    - Generous limits: Up to 20 attachments per email, 40MB per file
    - Currently works with all transactional emails

    Whether you’re sending invoices, reports, or onboarding documents, attachments just work.

## Fixes

The pricing page during onboarding were facing some data issues. No more squinting at plan details or wondering which tier includes what.

As always, let us know if you run into issues or have feedback. We’re listening (and probably already working on the next thing you didn’t know you needed).
