import { SUPPORT_EMAIL } from '/snippets/custom-variables.mdx'

Before you can send emails through AutoSend, you need to verify ownership of your sending domain. This ensures:

- **Email deliverability**: Verified domains have better inbox placement rates
- **Authentication**: Proves you own the domain you’re sending from
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized use of your domain for sending emails
- **Compliance**: Meets industry standards for email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

<Note>
  We recommend using a subdomain (like" " <code className="nextra-code">
  mail.yourdomain.com</code>

   or" " <code className="nextra-code">
  emails.yourdomain.com</code>

  ) instead of your root domain. This provides better email deliverability and keeps your transactional emails separate from your main domain's reputation.
