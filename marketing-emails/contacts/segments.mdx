## What are Segments in AutoSend

**Segments** are dynamic groups of contacts created based on conditions or filters (e.g., “account_type=pro,” “country = United States,” etc.). They update automatically as contacts meet or stop meeting the criteria.

Segments helps you target your audience based on real-time data. For example, you can create a segment of users who signed up last month or those who haven’t opened your last three campaigns.
