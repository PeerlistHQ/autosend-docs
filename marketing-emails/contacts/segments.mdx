## What are Segments in AutoSend

**Segments** are dynamic groups of contacts created based on conditions or filters (e.g., “account_type=pro,” “country = United States,” etc.). They update automatically as contacts meet or stop meeting the criteria.

Segments helps you target your audience based on real-time data. For example, you can create a segment of users who signed up last month or those who haven’t opened your last three campaigns.

## How to Create a Segment in AutoSend

1. From the Marketing Emails section, click on the **Contacts** tab
2. Go to **Lists and Segments.**
3. From the **Create** dropdown, select **New Segment**.


1. Name your segment, and select the list that you are creating this segment from.
2. Set your segment criteria (field, condition, value)
3. Save the segment.

<Note>
  The segment will auto-update as contacts meet your defined criteria.
