Contacts are the people you send emails to in AutoSend. Each contact has a unique email address and associated data like name, location, or any other information you’ve added through fields.

Contacts can be organized using **Lists** or **Segments** for better targeting.

- Sign-ups or form submissions

You can filter and search contacts, and view detailed insights for each.


## Contact Details

Clicking on any contact opens their **Contact Details** page, where you can view:

### Custom Fields

<a href={APP_PATHS.customFields} title='Custom fields'>Custom fields</a> let you store additional information beyond the reserved ones — for example, “Company,” “Plan Type,” or “Signup Date.”

They can be text, number, or date fields

You can use these in both **marketing campaigns** and **transactional emails** to personalize your content using variables like `{{custom_field_name}}`.
