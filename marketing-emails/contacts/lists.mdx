## What are Lists in AutoSend

A list is a collection of contacts grouped together based on custom fields. By default, all your contacts are stored in the `All Contacts` list.

Lists are great for grouping contacts based on fixed criteria. E.g., “Newsletter Subscribers” or “Event Attendees.”

## How to create a List in AutoSend

1. From the Marketing Emails section, click on the **Contacts** tab
2. Go to **Lists and Segments.**
3. From the **Create** dropdown, select **New List**.


4. In the modal, name and create your list.
5. Once created you can add contacts to your list by **adding them manually** or by **uploading a CSV file.**
