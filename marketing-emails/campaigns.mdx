## What are Campaigns in AutoSend?

Campaigns in **AutoSend** are one-time or scheduled marketing emails that you send to your contacts, lists, or segments. These are typically newsletters, announcements, or promotional emails designed to engage your audience.

Create your email using HTML with inline CSS for styling. AutoSend's email designer supports responsive design, so make sure to write HTML that renders well across different email clients and devices.

- Write responsive HTML with inline CSS for maximum compatibility.
- Use variables anywhere in the HTML to personalize content dynamically, for example: `{{first_name}}`, `{{company_name}}`, `{{email}}`, etc.
- Variables are wrapped in double curly braces and will be replaced with actual values when the email is sent.
- Keep your HTML clean and well-structured to ensure consistent rendering across email clients.
- Test your template thoroughly in both desktop and mobile views before deployment.

**Preview and Devices**

The **Email Preview** on the right reflects changes from the composer in real time. Switch between **Desktop** and **Mobile** via the device icons to confirm responsive behavior and visual consistency. Links are disabled in preview to avoid accidental navigation.
