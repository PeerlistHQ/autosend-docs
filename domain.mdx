import { urlFormatter } from '/snippets/utils.mdx'

Before you can send emails through AutoSend, you need to verify ownership of your sending domain. This ensures:

- **Email deliverability**: Verified domains have better inbox placement rates
- **Authentication**: Proves you own the domain you’re sending from
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized use of your domain for sending emails
- **Compliance**: Meets industry standards for email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

<Note>
**Pro Tip: Use a Subdomain**

We recommend using a subdomain (like `mail.yourdomain.com` or `emails.yourdomain.com`) instead of your root domain. This provides better email deliverability and keeps your transactional emails separate from your main domain’s reputation.

</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Your Domain" titleSize="h3">
1. Navigate to **Settings > Domains** in your AutoSend dashboard and click the **Add Domain** button.
<Frame>
<img src='/images/domain/domain-empty.png' alt='Domain empty' />
</Frame>
2. Enter your sending domain **without** `http://` or `https://`
<Frame>
<img src='/images/domain/domain-add.png' alt='Domain add' />
</Frame>
3. Choose the AWS region closest to your users for optimal email delivery performance. Available regions include:
    - **US East (N. Virginia)** - `us-east-1`
    - **US East (Ohio)** - `us-east-2`
    
The region you select will be used to send your emails and should be chosen based on where most of your recipients are located.
    
<Note> If you want support for other regions, please contact us at <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`} title={SUPPORT_EMAIL}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a> </Note>
    
</Step>
<Step title="Configure DNS Records" titleSize="h3">

Once your domain is added, AutoSend will generate the required DNS records. You’ll need to add these records to your domain’s DNS settings. AutoSend requires two types of DNS records:

### **DKIM and SPF Records (Required)**

These records enable email authentication and prevent email spoofing. You’ll typically see 3-4 records:

1. **Ownership Verification Record**: Verifies you own the domain
2. **DKIM Record(s)**: Cryptographic signatures that prove email authenticity
3. **Mail-From Record**: Specifies authorized email sending servers (SPF)
<Frame>
<img src='/images/domain/domain-verify-ownership.png' alt='Domain verify ownership' />
</Frame>
Each record will have the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | DNS record type (CNAME or TXT) |
| **Name** | The subdomain or host record |
| **Content/Value** | The record value to add |
| **Priority** | Used for MX records (usually not applicable) |
| **TTL** | Time To Live - set to “Auto” or 3600 |

### **DMARC Record (Optional but Recommended)**

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) adds an extra layer of email authentication and provides reporting on email authentication status.

<Note>
**Note**
- Copy the exact values from AutoSend - even small typos can cause verification to fail
- Some DNS providers add your domain name automatically - check your provider’s documentation
- Use the copy button next to each record value in AutoSend to avoid errors
- All DKIM and SPF records must be added for successful verification
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Your Domain" titleSize="h3">
After adding all DNS records to your DNS provider:

1. **Wait for DNS propagation** (typically 5-30 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours)
2. Navigate back to your domain details page in AutoSend
3. Click the **“Verify Ownership”** or **“Check Verification”** button

### **Verification Statuses**

Your domain will progress through these statuses:

| **Status** | **Badge Color** | **Description** | **Action Required** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unverified** | Red | No DNS records found | Add DNS records to your provider |
| **Pending** | Orange | DNS records found, verification in progress | Wait for DNS propagation (5 mins - 2 hours) |
| **Verified** | Green | Domain fully verified and ready to use | None - you can start sending! |
| **Verification Failed** | Red | DNS records incorrect or missing | Check your DNS records and try again |
<Frame>
<img src='/images/domain/domain-verified.png' alt='Domain verified' />
</Frame>
<Check> When your domain shows a green “Verified” badge, you’re all set! You can now use this domain to send emails through AutoSend’s API.</Check>

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not verifying?

If your domain verification is stuck or failing, try these steps:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check DNS Propagation">
    DNS changes can take time to propagate globally. Use a DNS checker tool to verify your records are visible:

    - <a
            href={urlFormatter(DNS_CHECKER_LINK, {
              addRef: true,
              additionalQueryParams: {
                utm_source: AUTOSEND_DOCS_DOMAIN,
                utm_content: "troubleshooting",
              },
            })}
            title="DNS Checker"
            target='_blank'
          >
            <span className="text-brand-500">DNS Checker</span>
          </a>
    -  <a
            href={urlFormatter(WHATS_MY_DNS_LINK, {
              addRef: true,
              additionalQueryParams: {
                utm_source: AUTOSEND_DOCS_DOMAIN,
                utm_content: "troubleshooting",
              },
            })}
            title="WhatsMyDNS"
             target='_blank'
          >
            <span className="text-brand-500">WhatsMyDNS</span>
          </a>

    Enter your domain and check if the records appear globally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Record Values">
    - Ensure you copied the **exact** values from AutoSend (including any underscores or periods)
    - Check for extra spaces or hidden characters
    - Verify the record **Type** is correct (CNAME vs TXT)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Domain Name Format">
    Some DNS providers automatically append your domain name to records. For example:

    - AutoSend shows: `_amazonses.mail.yourdomain.com`
    - Your provider might only need: `_amazonses.mail` or `_amazonses`

    Check your provider's documentation for the correct format.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wait Longer for Propagation">
    DNS propagation typically takes:

    - **5-30 minutes** for most providers
    - **Up to 2 hours** for some providers
    - **Up to 48 hours** in rare cases

    Be patient and try verifying again after waiting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete and Re-add Records">
    If records still aren't working:

    1. Delete all AutoSend-related DNS records
    2. Wait 10-15 minutes
    3. Re-add all records carefully
    4. Wait for propagation
    5. Try verification again
