    My friends at @AutoSendEmail just launched on Product Hunt. It's an email platform that charges by volume, not contacts. Check it out: [link]
    ```

    **Option 2:**
    ```
    If you're tired of email providers charging you for contacts sitting in your database, check out @AutoSendEmail. They just launched on Product Hunt: [link]
    ```

    **Option 3:**
    ```
    .@AutoSendEmail is live on Product Hunt today. Finally an email platform with pricing that makes sense. [link]

    AutoSend just launched on Product Hunt. If you're building something and need an email provider that doesn't charge you for contacts you're not even emailing, give them a look. [link]
    ```

    **Option 2:**
    ```
    A friend of mine just launched AutoSend on Product Hunt. It's an email delivery platform for developers with volume-based pricing instead of contact-based. Simple idea, but it changes a lot. Check it out if you get a chance. [link]
    ```

    **Option 3:**
    ```
    AutoSend is live on Product Hunt today. I've been using it for my email infrastructure and the experience has been solid. If you're looking for an alternative to the usual suspects, worth a look. [link]
    ```

    **Option 4:**
    ```
    Product Hunt launch day for AutoSend. It's an email platform built for developers with a pricing model that actually makes sense: pay for what you send, not how many contacts you have sitting in a database. Rooting for them. [link]
    ```

    **Option 5:**
    ```
    Congrats to the AutoSend team on their Product Hunt launch. If you're a developer or running a growing product, their volume-based pricing is a breath of fresh air compared to most email providers. [link]
