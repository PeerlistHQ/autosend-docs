title: 'What are Variables in AutoSend?'
description: 'Variables let you personalize your transactional emails by dynamically inserting data such as a recipient’s name, order details, or verification link into your email templates.'
sidebarTitle: 'Variables'

Instead of hardcoding values, you can use placeholders that AutoSend replaces with actual data when sending the email via API.

For example:

```
Hi {{firstName}}, your order {{order_id}} has been shipped!
```

When the email is sent, it becomes:

```
Hi Robert, your order #2341 has been shipped!
```

Variables make your emails more personalized, relevant, and engaging, all without manually editing each message.

## How Variables Work

When you send a transactional email through the AutoSend Email API, you can include variables as key-value pairs in your request payload.

AutoSend automatically replaces these placeholders with their corresponding values in the email template before delivery.

### Example API Payload:

```json
{
  "to": "robert@example.com",
  "template_id": "welcome_email",
  "dynamicData": {
    "name": "Robert,
    "login_link": "https://app.autosend.io/login"
  }
}
```

### Example Template:

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Welcome to AutoSend! You can log in to your account using the link below:
{{login_link}}
```

### Resulting Email:

```
Hi Robert,

Welcome to AutoSend! You can log in to your account using the link below:
https://app.autosend.io/login

```

---

## Supported Variable Syntax

AutoSend uses **double curly braces `{{variable_name}}`** to identify variables inside email templates.

<Info>Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but must start with a letter (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{orderTotal}}`).</Info>

---

## Using Variables in Email Templates

You can use variables anywhere in the email:

- Subject line
- Body text
- Button URLs
- Links or call-to-actions

Example:

```
Subject: Welcome, {{first_name}}!

Body:
Hi {{first_name}},
Your account was created on {{signup_date}}.
Click below to verify your email:
{{verification_link}}
```

---

## Default and Custom Variables

### Default Variables

Some system-level variables are automatically available when sending emails through AutoSend.

For example:

- `{{email}}` — recipient’s email address
- `{{date}}` — current date

### Custom Variables

You can define your own custom variables when sending emails via the API. These can be anything specific to your workflow. Eg. `{{order_id}}`, `{{invoice_amount}}`, or `{{reset_link}}`.

---

## Using Dynamic Variables with Conditions

You can use simple `if/else` logic in your email templates to handle missing data. For example, if a user doesn’t have a `firstName`, you can fall back to a default like **“there”.**


``` jsx
Hello {{#if firstName}}{{firstName}}{{else}}there{{/if}}!
```

### What this does:
 - If `firstName` exists → `Hello Johan!`
 - If it’s missing/empty → `Hello there!`

This works for any variable in AutoSend, just wrap it with `{{#if}}{{else}}{{/if}}` to make your messages feel natural even when some data is unavailable. 

## Best Practices

- **Always test your templates** before sending live emails to ensure variables are replaced correctly.
- **Provide fallback values** in your system in case a variable is missing (e.g., “Hi there” if `{{name}}` is not provided).
- **Keep variable names descriptive** for better clarity and maintainability.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="If a variable doesn’t render correctly:">

  - Check that your variable name in the API payload exactly matches the placeholder in your template.
  - Ensure that the variable is passed under the `"variables"` object in your API request.
  - Preview the email in your AutoSend dashboard to confirm the replacement works as expected.
